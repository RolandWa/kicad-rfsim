"""Measure a body ESL from the FREQUENCY of a notch, not from an amplitude.

The board is a microstrip of 50 ohm with one capacitor in SHUNT to
ground (`run_lumped.make_shunt`). The capacitor, its pads and the via to
the plane make a SERIES resonance, thus |S21| has a deep notch at

    f0 = 1 / (2*pi*sqrt(L_total*C))

and the notch gives the inductance back:

    L_total = 1 / ((2*pi*f0)**2 * C)

L_total is the body ESL of the part PLUS the loop of the board (the
pads, the gap and the via). The board part of it is the same in every
run. Thus the ESL of the body comes from a DIFFERENCE of two runs:

    ESL(measured) = L_total(with the ESL) - L_total(with no ESL)

**Why a difference of frequencies, and not one absolute value.** The log
of 2026-08-04 (6) measured the extraction of an absolute value on the
series board: it carries 10 to 20 ohm of systematic error which the mesh
does not remove, against 3.1 ohm for an 0402 ESL at 2 GHz. That
systematic is a scale error of the amplitude, and no scale error can
move a frequency. This file is the method that remains.

The tool asserts three things:

1. Each run gives a deep notch (the resonance exists).
2. The board inductance is the same for two DIFFERENT capacitors. It is
   a property of the board, thus it must not follow the value of the
   part. This is the control of the method.
3. The measured ESL agrees with the value that went in, for 0.25 nH and
   for 1.0 nH.

`run_shunt.py <mesh> packages` does item 6b: it measures each entry of
`board_reader._ESL_NH` on the land pattern of its own package.

Run this file with the python of KiCad 10. It needs pcbnew, and it
starts the solver itself:
