"""Push a ground zone that has a HOLE through the SOLVER.

Backlog item 5, and the gap that "What is not tested" held the longest:
the extraction from a zone with holes is tested (the demo board with 6
layers and 444 vias), and no such polygon ever reached openEMS.
`Fracture` changes a hole into a slit with no width, and the value of
that trick was an ASSUMPTION:

- a slit that CLOSES joins the copper across the hole. The plane is then
  solid, the hole does nothing, and every number looks correct;
- a slit that OPENS too far cuts the plane in two, and the return
  current goes around the cut.

**A hole at the SIDE of the line cannot tell the two apart.** It moves
the impedance by less than the scatter of the mesh, thus a slit that
closed and a slit that worked give the same number. This board puts a
void of 8 x 6 mm DIRECTLY under the line, where the return current
flows: a working slit must then raise the impedance by a large step,
and a closed slit gives no step at all.

The measurement is the DIFFERENCE of two runs of the same board, in the
same way as `run_shunt.py`: `void=True` and `void=False`. Everything
else is identical, the three vias of the other net included.

Run it with the python of KiCad 10:
