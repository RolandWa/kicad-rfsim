"""A full test of a lumped element: a series resistor of 50 ohm in a
microstrip of 50 ohm.

For an ideal part with Z0 = 50, S21 = 2*Z0/(2*Z0+R) = -3.5 dB and
S11 = R/(R+2*Z0) = -9.5 dB. If the simulation ignored the resistor, the
gap would be an open circuit: S11 near 0 dB and S21 much lower. The
asserts below tell the two conditions apart.
