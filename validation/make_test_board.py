    into a slit with no width. Nobody showed that CSXCAD makes correct
    raster data from such a polygon. A slit that closes attaches the copper
    across the hole. A slit that opens too far cuts the plane. The board of
    `run_headless.py` has a plain rectangle on B.Cu, thus it cannot show
    these errors.

    **The hole is DIRECTLY below the line, and it is large.** That is the
