"""Validate the CPW port, the stripline port and the impedance readout.

Run this file with the python of KiCad 10:
    "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\KiCad\\10.0\\bin\\python.exe" run_cpw.py [mesh] [cpw|stripline]

**cpw** makes a grounded CPW of 30 mm. It has a line of 1.5 mm on F.Cu, a
ground at each side with a gap of 0.3 mm, and a full plane on B.Cu.

**stripline** makes a line of 30 mm on In1.Cu of a board with 4 layers,
between a plane on F.Cu and a plane on In2.Cu.

The test compares the measurement of the port against a closed formula.
Each type holds eps_eff AND the impedance of the line against the theory.
The eps_eff of a stripline must be equal to er. Thus that test is the most
accurate one in this directory.

A lumped port or a microstrip port on the same board gives a different
eps_eff. Thus this test stops with a failure if the new port changes to a
different type.
